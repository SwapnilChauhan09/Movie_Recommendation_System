- Found the exact product that you were looking up on amazon,
- Everybody at the high school is talking about this new cool Netflix series "squid game"  and when you open Netflix, the first thing
that you find "squid game"
- You just finished that amazing funny sitcom "Friends" and you got a suggestion to watch another similar "HIMYM"
- Got a recommendation for the second part of harry potter after completing the first one?

Well, these are just some very basic examples of recommendation systems action!
